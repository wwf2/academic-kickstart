I am an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the John D. Rockefeller IV School of Policy and Politics at West Virginia University. I study the causes and consequences of political and economic inequality in the United States. In trying to better understand the relationship between inequality and politics, my research focuses on the publicâ€™s attitudes about income inequality and redistribution, the influence of political participation bias on politics and policy, and how political decisions shape economic outcomes.
